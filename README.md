# TreeVisualizer

This JavaScript webpage allows users to visualize various types of tree data structures. Users can select the
type of tree and insert or delete nodes, and can choose to watch how the algorithms work for these tasks.

Currently, only the visualization is (partially) implemented; the different tree data structures are not yet complete.
